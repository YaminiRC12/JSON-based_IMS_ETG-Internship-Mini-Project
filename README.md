This repository contains the code and files for making inventory management system using Python .I have made this project on JupyterLab.
In this project:
1.I have used JSON file 
2.New products can be added
3.Purchase can be done 
4.Products can be deleted .
I've added 5 attributes per product -1.Name 2.Price 3.quantity available 4.Company 5.Rating
INTRODUCTION :
In this IMS I have taken Stationary products .The customer can purchase a product and then we check whether that product id is available in our records or not if it is not availble we'll display the message "Currently the product which you want is unavailable...".If product is available in our system then we'll ask for quantity of selected product.If quantity which customer entered is not available or out of stock then we'll display message saying" ðŸ˜”Sorry....Currently the quantity of selected product id is unavailable " and if it is avilable in our stock then all information of that product we'll be displyed and  generate bill of selected products.Simultaneously the quantity of that product will reduce in records and we can see this in json file.If admin wants to add or delete items from records then this can also be done in this Inventory Management System.
Also I have created sales file which contain all the transactions.
